# /freeze — Restrict Edits to a Directory

Lock file edits to a specific directory. Any Edit or Write operation targeting
a file outside the allowed path will be **blocked** (not just warned).

## Preamble

Before executing this skill:

1. **Load context from memory**:
   ```
   memory_search(query: "{skill-relevant-query}", associative: true, limit: 5)
   memory_search(tag: "{skill-name}", limit: 3)
   ```
   Review returned memories for relevant past context, decisions, and patterns.

2. **Check OMC state for active work**:
   ```
   state_get_status()
   ```
   If conflicting active tasks exist, warn the user before proceeding.

3. **Detect current branch** (for git-related skills):
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "not-a-git-repo"
   ```

4. **Check proactive mode**:
   ```
   state_read("occ-proactive")
   ```
   If `"false"`: do NOT proactively suggest other OpenClaw-CC skills during this session.
   Only run skills the user explicitly invokes.

5. **Log skill activation**:
   ```
   memory_daily_log(type: "note", entry: "Skill activated: /{skill-name}")
   ```

## Setup

Ask the user which directory to restrict edits to. Use AskUserQuestion:

- Question: "Which directory should I restrict edits to? Files outside this path will be blocked from editing."
- Text input (not multiple choice) — the user types a path.

Once the user provides a directory path:

1. Resolve it to an absolute path:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR=$(cd "<user-provided-path>" 2>/dev/null && pwd)
echo "$FREEZE_DIR"
```

2. Ensure trailing slash and save to the freeze state file:
```bash
FREEZE_DIR="${FREEZE_DIR%/}/"
STATE_DIR="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA:-${HOME}/.omc/state}"
mkdir -p "$STATE_DIR"
echo "$FREEZE_DIR" > "$STATE_DIR/freeze-dir.txt"
echo "Freeze boundary set: $FREEZE_DIR"
```

3. Log to memory:
```
memory_daily_log(type: "note", entry: "Freeze boundary set: {path}")
```

Tell the user: "Edits are now restricted to `<path>/`. Any Edit or Write outside this directory will be blocked. Run `/unfreeze` to remove the restriction."

## How it works

The hook reads `file_path` from the Edit/Write tool input JSON, then checks
whether the path starts with the freeze directory. If not, it returns
`permissionDecision: "deny"` to block the operation.

## Notes

- Trailing `/` prevents `/src` from matching `/src-old`
- Freeze applies to Edit and Write only — Read, Bash, Glob, Grep are unaffected
- This prevents accidental edits, not a security boundary
- To deactivate, run `/unfreeze` or end the conversation

## Completion Status Protocol

Every skill must end with one of these status codes:

| Code | Meaning | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **DONE** | All steps completed, evidence provided | Root cause found + fix verified, PR created, review finished |
| **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** | Completed with warnings or caveats | Tests pass but coverage dropped, fix applied but can't fully verify |
| **BLOCKED** | Cannot proceed, requires user intervention | 3 failed attempts, missing permissions, external dependency down |
| **NEEDS_CONTEXT** | Missing information to continue | Unclear requirements, need user clarification |

### Escalation Rules

1. **3-strike rule**: After 3 failed attempts at any step, **STOP** and escalate to user.
   Do not continue guessing. Present what was tried and ask for direction.

2. **Scope escalation**: If fix/change touches 5+ files unexpectedly, pause and confirm
   with the user before proceeding.

3. **Security uncertainty**: If you are unsure about a security implication, **STOP** and
   escalate. Never guess on security.

4. **Verification requirement**: Never claim DONE without evidence.
   - "Should work" → RUN IT. Confidence is not evidence.
   - "Already tested earlier" → Code changed since. Test again.
   - "Trivial change" → Trivial changes break production.

### Output Format

```
═══════════════════════════════════════
Status: {DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT}
Summary: {one-line description of outcome}
Evidence: {test output, verification results, or blocking reason}
═══════════════════════════════════════
