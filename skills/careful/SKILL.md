# /careful — Destructive Command Guardrails

Safety mode is now **active**. Every bash command will be checked for destructive
patterns before running. If a destructive command is detected, you'll be warned
and can choose to proceed or cancel.

## Preamble

Before executing this skill:

1. **Load context from memory**:
   ```
   memory_search(query: "{skill-relevant-query}", associative: true, limit: 5)
   memory_search(tag: "{skill-name}", limit: 3)
   ```
   Review returned memories for relevant past context, decisions, and patterns.

2. **Check OMC state for active work**:
   ```
   state_get_status()
   ```
   If conflicting active tasks exist, warn the user before proceeding.

3. **Detect current branch** (for git-related skills):
   ```bash
   git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null || echo "not-a-git-repo"
   ```

4. **Check proactive mode**:
   ```
   state_read("occ-proactive")
   ```
   If `"false"`: do NOT proactively suggest other OpenClaw-CC skills during this session.
   Only run skills the user explicitly invokes.

5. **Log skill activation**:
   ```
   memory_daily_log(type: "note", entry: "Skill activated: /{skill-name}")
   ```

## What's protected

| Pattern | Example | Risk |
|---------|---------|------|
| `rm -rf` / `rm -r` / `rm --recursive` | `rm -rf /var/data` | Recursive delete |
| `DROP TABLE` / `DROP DATABASE` | `DROP TABLE users;` | Data loss |
| `TRUNCATE` | `TRUNCATE orders;` | Data loss |
| `git push --force` / `-f` | `git push -f origin main` | History rewrite |
| `git reset --hard` | `git reset --hard HEAD~3` | Uncommitted work loss |
| `git checkout .` / `git restore .` | `git checkout .` | Uncommitted work loss |
| `kubectl delete` | `kubectl delete pod` | Production impact |
| `docker rm -f` / `docker system prune` | `docker system prune -a` | Container/image loss |
| `DELETE FROM` (without WHERE) | `DELETE FROM users` | Mass data deletion |

## Safe exceptions

These patterns are allowed without warning:
- `rm -rf node_modules` / `.next` / `dist` / `__pycache__` / `.cache` / `build` / `.turbo` / `coverage` / `.omc`

## How it works

The hook reads the command from the tool input JSON, checks it against the
patterns above, and returns `permissionDecision: "ask"` with a warning message
if a match is found. You can always override the warning and proceed.

## Memory Integration

```
memory_daily_log(type: "note", entry: "Safety mode activated: /careful")
```

To deactivate, end the conversation or start a new one. Hooks are session-scoped.

## Completion Status Protocol

Every skill must end with one of these status codes:

| Code | Meaning | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **DONE** | All steps completed, evidence provided | Root cause found + fix verified, PR created, review finished |
| **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** | Completed with warnings or caveats | Tests pass but coverage dropped, fix applied but can't fully verify |
| **BLOCKED** | Cannot proceed, requires user intervention | 3 failed attempts, missing permissions, external dependency down |
| **NEEDS_CONTEXT** | Missing information to continue | Unclear requirements, need user clarification |

### Escalation Rules

1. **3-strike rule**: After 3 failed attempts at any step, **STOP** and escalate to user.
   Do not continue guessing. Present what was tried and ask for direction.

2. **Scope escalation**: If fix/change touches 5+ files unexpectedly, pause and confirm
   with the user before proceeding.

3. **Security uncertainty**: If you are unsure about a security implication, **STOP** and
   escalate. Never guess on security.

4. **Verification requirement**: Never claim DONE without evidence.
   - "Should work" → RUN IT. Confidence is not evidence.
   - "Already tested earlier" → Code changed since. Test again.
   - "Trivial change" → Trivial changes break production.

### Output Format

```
═══════════════════════════════════════
Status: {DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT}
Summary: {one-line description of outcome}
Evidence: {test output, verification results, or blocking reason}
═══════════════════════════════════════
```
