## Completion Status Protocol

Every skill must end with one of these status codes:

| Code | Meaning | When to Use |
|------|---------|-------------|
| **DONE** | All steps completed, evidence provided | Root cause found + fix verified, PR created, review finished |
| **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** | Completed with warnings or caveats | Tests pass but coverage dropped, fix applied but can't fully verify |
| **BLOCKED** | Cannot proceed, requires user intervention | 3 failed attempts, missing permissions, external dependency down |
| **NEEDS_CONTEXT** | Missing information to continue | Unclear requirements, need user clarification |

### Escalation Rules

1. **3-strike rule**: After 3 failed attempts at any step, **STOP** and escalate to user.
   Do not continue guessing. Present what was tried and ask for direction.

2. **Scope escalation**: If fix/change touches 5+ files unexpectedly, pause and confirm
   with the user before proceeding.

3. **Security uncertainty**: If you are unsure about a security implication, **STOP** and
   escalate. Never guess on security.

4. **Verification requirement**: Never claim DONE without evidence.
   - "Should work" → RUN IT. Confidence is not evidence.
   - "Already tested earlier" → Code changed since. Test again.
   - "Trivial change" → Trivial changes break production.

### Output Format

```
═══════════════════════════════════════
Status: {DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT}
Summary: {one-line description of outcome}
Evidence: {test output, verification results, or blocking reason}
═══════════════════════════════════════
